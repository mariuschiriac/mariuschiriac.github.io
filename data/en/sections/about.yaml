summary: '
My name is Marius Chiriac and I love everything programming-related! <br> I started as a web developer and later took game programming classes at the <a href="https://dbgameacademy.it/" target="_blank"> Digital Bros Game Academy</a>.
I now spend most of my time perfecting my programming skills as well as pursuing art, modeling, and design. I am especially fond of the Role Playing Game (RPG) genre.
I am a passionate software engineer with more than 5 years of working experience. '
